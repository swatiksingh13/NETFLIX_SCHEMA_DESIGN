# NETFLIX_SCHEMA_DESIGN
**Design Database Schema for a system like Netflix with the following Use Cases.**

## Use Cases
1. Netflix has users.
2. Every user has an email and a password.
3. Users can create profiles to have separate independent environments.
4. Each profile has a name and a type. Type can be KID or ADULT.
5. There are multiple videos on netflix.
6. For each video, there will be a title, description and a cast.
7. A cast is a list of actors who were a part of the video. For each actor we need to know their name and list of videos they were a part of.
8. For every video, for any profile who watched that video, we need to know the status (COMPLETED/ IN PROGRESS).
9. For every profile for whom a video is in progress, we want to know their last watch timestamp.
